The configuration of Nog is written in a superset of [Rhai](https://github.com/jonathandturner/rhai), which is an embedded scripting language for Rust that allows you to easily define a custom syntax for your needs.

After you start Nog for the first time it fills your configuration file, which lives in `%APPDATA%/nog/config.nog` with the default config.
