## Status

I have very litte free time in October 2020, so the development will slow down until at least November. Hopefully I'll have more free time this November and onwards.

(I currently have to work a lot)

## [WIP] Documentation

https://timuntersberger.github.io/nog

## Download

In almost all cases the [development](https://github.com/TimUntersberger/nog/releases/tag/development-release) release is the way to go.

## Development

### Create Executable

```
$env:NOG_VERSION="<version>"
