The easiest way of installing Nog is by downloading an already built executable of a release.

There exist two main release channels:

* [Latest](https://github.com/TimUntersberger/nog/releases/latest)
* [Development](https://github.com/TimUntersberger/nog/releases/tag/development-release)

Furthermore, whenever a new branch gets created it automatically gets its own release with the name `<branch-name>-release`. This means that if there currently is a feature missing that someone is already working on and you want, you can always checkout the prebuilt release for the branch.

Starting the executable for the first time results in a new folder being created with the following path `%APPDATA%/nog/`.
